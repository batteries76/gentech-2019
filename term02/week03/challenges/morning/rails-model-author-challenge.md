# Model challenge - Author

1. Follow [yesterday's notes](https://github.com/batteries76/gentech-2019/blob/master/term02/week03/day02.md) on Rails models.
2. Create *another* model in your project called **Author** - ensure that you *seed* and *migrate* the database.
3. Create the Rails resources required to display all author names (route, controller, view).
4. Use **Active Record** to insert new **Author** records (you can create a form for this or hard code the data in a controller method - the point is to use Active Record)
5. View the results in the browser.
6. Use the Rails console to view the contents of the database.
