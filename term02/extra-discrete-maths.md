### Sum of

Σ 
This is the symbol that tells us that we are getting the sum of something. Mostly (for our purposes) we will be getting the sum of a finite series of numbers. Eg, Σ <br>
<sub>n = 5</sub><br>

⎲f(x) = x <sup>2</sup><br>
⎳<br>
<sup>n = 0</sup><br>
In this world (the Discrete Maths world), there are no fractions. So we know that
