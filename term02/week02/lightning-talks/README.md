# Lightning Talks

## What now?

For the next few weeks (like 22) we will be concluding each week (Wednesday, 16:45) with a **lightning talk** given by a student who will be chosen at random. This is *not* an assessment task but it *is* good for *all* of us. :relaxed:

## What is a lightning talk?

A **lightning talk** is a short presentation between 5 and 10 minutes in duration which covers a particular topic. Literally any topic can be presented in this format! The goal is to *enlighten* your audience about a particular topic, and generate thought and even action.

A *good* lightning talk is more like a *story* - and people love stories!

A lightning talk may stand alone or it may be given as an introduction or *taster* for a subsequent larger presentation. Slides and media typically accompany the talk.

Maybe you are...

* :point_right: Sharing an idea with your colleagues
* :point_right: Reporting progress on a project


## Practicing your presentation skills

Giving a lightning talk is a great way to practice your presentation skills!

Here's some tips...

* :point_right: Your story needs a beginning (introduction), a middle (the story) and an end (final thoughts).
* :point_right: Slides should be more descriptive  (images) than *wordy*.
* :point_right:  Don't read from slides or read *to* them!
* :point_right: It's your story  - own it!

Here's some tools for creating slides...

* :point_right: Google Slides
* :point_right: [Prezi](https://prezi.com)

## I have *so* many ideas/stories I could share!

See what I did there? So think about a series of fortunate or unfortunate events in your life...

* :point_right: going from *zero to hero* when I was 7 years old
* :point_right: facing my fear of skydiving
* :point_right: missing out on the bull-riding championship prize
* :point_right: persevering through illness
* :point_right: caring for a relative
* :point_right: that time I nearly...
* :point_right: one day I'm going to...

## I'm going to start preparing right away!

Good idea because your name could be chosen at any time. Get your slides and notes done, put them in the bank and then *wait*. While you are waiting you will get to hear the stories given by many other students - unless you get drawn first or second...:sweat_smile:
