1. Create a basic Sinatra app.
2. Add some routes.
3. Serve some of the data that you have found in the API from the routes you have made.

4. Use that data to create some ERb files, and serve those files.

5. Have your route also be able to react to the query string, and display different things based on the query string. Even better, relate that back to the data that you choose to send from the API.
