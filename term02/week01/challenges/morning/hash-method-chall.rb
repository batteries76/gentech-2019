# Hash method challenge

# 1. *Passing a hash to method...*
#     1. Create a hash containing at least 3 key/value pairs
#     2. Write a method that takes a hash. The method prints all values in the hash.
#     3. Call the method and pass the hash.


# 2. *Initialise an object using a hash...*

#     1. Create a class called Foo which has the following instance variables:
#         * x
#         * y
#         * z
#     2. The constructor takes a hash argument which is used to initialise each instance variable.
#     3. Create 3 instances of Foo - each with unique attribute values.


# 3. *Select hash values conditionally...*

#     1. Create a hash which contains player names and their scores...
#         * straven - 100
#         * kidd_thunda - 99
#         * rakky - 98
#         * killer_emmy - 97 
#         * space_toy 50

#     2. Write a method that takes the player score hash. 
#     3. Use .select to return all players with a score greater than or equal to 99. https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Hash.html#method-i-select
#     4. Print the result.
