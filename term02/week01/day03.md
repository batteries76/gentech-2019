## Sinatra
- On day one we saw how we can make a simple server with WEBrick, and then add routes to that server.
- We also looked at Sinatra briefly, and saw that it works in a similar way, but helps by sorting out the low level stuff for us behind the scenes, so that we can concentrate on the parts of the app that are more important to us.
- Sinatra configures and runs a server for us (which can be WEBrick, or Thin, or Puma). 
- Sinatra is known as a *_DSL_*, which is slightly unecessary jargon. It stands for 'Domain Specific Language', which is a specially designed superset of a language used for a specific set of circumstances.
- Here the most basic function we are using Sinatra for is to make a server that can listen and respond, and configuring some routes to respond in different ways.
- Here is an example Sinatra app:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
    erb :index
end

get '/this-app-works' do
    "<h1> Big Heading something </h1>"
end

get '/elephant' do
    erb(:elephant)
end

get '/pokemon' do 
    @pokemon = [
        {
          name:"bulbasaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png"
        },
        {
          name:"ivysaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/2.png"
        },
        {
          name:"venusaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/3.png"
        },
        {
          name:"charmander",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/4.png"
        },
        {
          name:"charmeleon",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/5.png"
        }
    ]
    erb(:pokemon)
end

get '/frank-says' do
    "Put this in your pipe & smoke it!"
end

post '/frank-says' do 
    "Something different from the get request"
end

get '/teams' do
    @data = [
        {
            id: 1,
            team: 'Collingwood',
            city: 'Melbourne',
            premierships: 15
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            team: 'West Coast',
            city: 'Perth',
            premierships: 4
        }
    ]
    erb(:teams)
end
```

- Here is much the same code, but with explanatory comments embedded:

```ruby
# Same deal here. Requiring in heaps of code. This time the code will bring with it other gems that will run behind the scenes. There was magic with WEBrick, but it was low level. This time there is much more magic.
# We are also seeing the start of the separation of concerns here, with most of our views not being mixed in with the code, but syphoned off into files in their own folder (/views). This is the V (views - the visible and presentation part of the application) in MVC.
require 'sinatra'

# This next gem will help by reloading your server code without having to stop and restart the server. 
# > gem install sinatra-reloader (just to be confusing).
# Sometimes it will be best to stop and restart the server manually, particularly if the changes are not being reflected - 'sinatra/reloader' is not a perfect solution to that problem.
require 'sinatra/reloader'

# From here we are setting up out routes. The routes can take (almost) any string we like (keep in mind what you know about URI's and delimiters). Sinatra takes care of setting up the response object for us, and doing all the work of attaching things. Much more of the process is performed behind the scenes here. 
get '/' do
    # In this instance we are using Sinatra's erb method to send back a particular embedded ruby file, in this case 'index.erb'. This is convention for the '/', but we could call the file whatever we like.
    erb :index
end

# This example shows that Sinatra will attempt to render the last element in the block by default. 
get '/this-app-works' do
    "<h1> Big Heading something </h1>"
    # If the following was the last line of the block it would still render it. In this example Sinatra concatenates the stings. An array of numbers errors out.
    # arr = ["a","b","c"]
end

# In general, the name of the file to be served is the same as that of the path. This is convention, and often the framework will work on this basis by default (that is, if no file is given then it will look for a file of the same name as the path in /views to render). Sinatra asks that we specify a file though. I could have rendered index.erb, or pokemon.erb, but here I am following convention and rendering elephant.erb.
get '/elephant' do
    erb(:elephant)
end

# This one shows how we can access instance variables in our ERb files. ERbs are HTML files with embedded ruby. The browser *cannot* read ruby, so they have to be processed before they are sent from the server back to the browser. The erb method does this for us. It looks at the value of the instance method, and then processes the HTML that is produced as a result. The pure HTML is then sent out in response (attached as the response message/body).
get '/pokemon' do 
    # Here we are hardcoding the data into the route. This will be replaced by calls to external elements in the future.
    @pokemon = [
        {
          name:"bulbasaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png"
        },
        {
          name:"ivysaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/2.png"
        },
        {
          name:"venusaur",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/3.png"
        },
        {
          name:"charmander",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/4.png"
        },
        {
          name:"charmeleon",
          url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/5.png"
        }
    ]
    erb(:pokemon)
end

# This route is detritus from early on, but is useful now to show the difference in the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PATCH, etc). The contrast is made with the post method that follows this method.
get '/frank-says' do
    "Put this in your pipe & smoke it!"
end

# We haven't officially seen how to make a POST request yet, but the key thing here is that it is a totally separate request from the get request with the same path name. It's vital to understand that although the path is the same, the code is separate, and does something different in our application.
post '/frank-says' do 
    "Something different from the get request"
end

# Here is some more hardcoded data that is being served back to the browser. In the future we will not hardcode this data, and instead get it from some sort of storage - a file, a CSV file, a relational database (one that has tables, eg. SQLite, Postgres), or a document/NoSQL database (one that stores objects that look more like hashes, eg. Mongo).
get '/teams' do
    @data = [
        {
            id: 1,
            team: 'Collingwood',
            city: 'Melbourne',
            premierships: 15
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            team: 'West Coast',
            city: 'Perth',
            premierships: 4
        }
    ]
    erb(:teams)
end
```

## ERb
- ERb is Embedded ruby. It comes by default with Sinatra.
- Sinatra can serve plain HTML files too. Embeeded ruby is an add on to the HTML we are familiar with.
- Embedded ruby gives us the power to run ruby code within our HTML.
- This gives us the ability to have our HTML be written so that it reacts to the variables we are creating in our app on the back end.
- Browsers do not understand ruby - they only read HTML and CSS (and JavaScript).
- As such, we need something to create the pure HTML from our ERb files. The `erb` method takes the instance variables we create, and produces HTML that results from our ERbs. 
- Here is an example ERb file:

```html
<h1> POKEMON </h1>

<% @pokemon.each do |pokemon| %>
    <h2><%= pokemon[:name] %></h2>
    <img src=<%= pokemon[:url] %> >
<% end %>
```

- The pure ruby commands are wrapped in `<% %>`. These are to be evaluated as ruby logic. These are not displayed to the browser, but they have an effect on what is or isn't displayed, or on how many elements are displayed.
- The elements that are to be evaluated and displayed are wrapped in `<%= %>` (note the extra `=`). These are the elements that we are showing on the front end. 
- We need to take care of the variables and the logic, and Sinatra works out how to send the HTML to the browser.
- As you can see, Sinatra takes care of many of the elements that we were responsible for when using WEBrick.

## MVC and separation of concerns
- Here we also see the start of the Model View Controller paradigm of making applications. 
- It is a useful way to organise your application so that it is easier to understand, and more flexible.
- It was not until Sinatra forces the wiews out into their own folder (through an error message) that we see this construct enforced in any way.
- Sinatra is light touch when it comes to enforcing MVC conventions. Rails will have much more to say on the issue.
- We will discuss this much more in the coming week.

## Other HTTP methods
- To start with we have been looking only at HTTP GET requests.
- This is just one type of HTTP request.
- We briefly discussed that there are other types of request, including POST, PATCH, and DELETE.
- We will cover this in more depth this coming week.
