# User Challenge!

# A User has a username, preferred display name and a list of interests (array of strings is fine).
# 1. Define a class called User which contains the attributes given above.
# 2. Each attribute should be initialised in the constructor.
# 3. Each attribute should be readable and writable.
# 4. Instantiate (create) 3 instances of User. Call them user1, user2 and user3.
# 5. Display the value of each user attribute.
# 6. Change the preferred display name of user1, and then display the changed value.
# 7. Define an array called users_array, and then place user1, user2 and user3 into the array.
# 8. Iterate (loop) through the array and display the value of each user attribute.

# Optional/Beast
# 1. Create a class called UserInterests which has a list of interests (array of strings is fine).
# 2. Add methods which allow the list of interests to be read and added to.
# 3. Modify the User class - incorporate the UserInterests class and remove the existing array.
