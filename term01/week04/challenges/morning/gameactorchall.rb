# I recommend that you add the following to yesterday's solution. Although these additional entities do not yet interact with the rest of the game, they will eventually.

# A game actor is not a player. It has a name and a health damage (this represents the health damage it can inflict on any player).
# 1. Define the game actor class. It must be initialised with a name and health damage input.
# 2. Create methods which allow read and write access to instance attributes.
# 3. Provide a to_s implementation which contains all instance attributes.

# A Wanderer is a game actor which can stroll and powerwalk. 
# 1. Define the Wanderer class including the behaviours mentioned. Implement these methods so that they simply return a string which echos the current behaviour name.

# Create instances.
# 1. Create 2 Wanderer instances.
# 2. Print each attribute.
# 3. Call and print the result from each method, including the string representation of the object.
