# .csv parsing challenge

1. Save the file called widget-data.csv to your project directory. Take note of the headers and general structure of the data in the file.
2. Read the data into memory. You may use your own choice of data structure to store the data (hashes, arrays, hash of hashes, array of hashes, etc), however, the data should remain organised in such a way that the data can be identified by it's category.
3. Improve your code so that it can parse *any* .csv file - not *just this* .csv.
4. Re-organise your code...
* Place your code into a method.
* Place your method into a class. The method takes the file name to read.
* Place your class into a module.
5. In a separate file, get an instance of the class and call the method that reads from the given file name.
