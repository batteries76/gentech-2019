# Greeting hash challenge

# 1. Define a hash called greeting which contains the language translations for a simple "Hello" greeting in several languages including English, Spanish, French and Japanese (and any others you know!).
# 2. Write a small menu based program which asks the user to select a language.
# 3. Display the greeting for that language - or if an invalid selection is made, the default greeting should be displayed in English.
##
# 4. Define a hash called farewell which contains the language translation for the farewell "Goodbye", including all of the same languages from the previous hash.
# 5. When the program ends, display the farewell for the user's given language.
##
# Absolute beast mode - maybe come back to this later...
# 1. Define a hash called language_dictionary.
# 2. Nest the greeting and farewell hashes within this hash so that the first key/value contains greetings and the second key/value contains farewells.
# 3. Modify your program to look up language translations from language_dictionary.
