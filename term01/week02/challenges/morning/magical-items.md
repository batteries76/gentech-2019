# Here's your magical morning challenge!
# Do your best to manifest the solutions for challenges 1 and 1.2.
# If you can't reveal the beast mode solutions right now, keep them with your unfinished spells and return to them later!

# Challenge 1 Magical Items

# A player has 1000 pieces of gold.
# A magical staff costs 500 pieces of gold.
# A spell costs 25 pieces of gold.
# A word from a wise owl costs 125 pieces of gold.

# Write a small menu-based program which asks the user which magical item they would like to buy. Each menu option is numbered. When the player selects a menu option, the cost of the item should be deducted from their gold balance. If the player buys "A word from a wise owl", display "Expecto patronum!", If the player enters a menu option which does not exist, a warning message should be displayed. Finally, display the player's gold balance.

# Challenge 1.2 Magical Items Loop
# The program should continue to display the menu options to the player; allowing them to make multiple purchases, until the player runs out of gold or wishes to exit the menu.

# Beast Mode

# Store the names of all magical items purchased by the player. Display the names when the player chooses to exit the menu.

# Beast mode+

# Allow the user to remove magical items from their purchases. The cost of the magical item should be refunded to the player.
