# Flexbox Challenge 1

*Wendy wants to hear about flexbox*

[CSS flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

In this challenge you will apply your new **HTML and CSS flexbox skills** to reproduce a web page of your choice. Choose a page which has "flexbox-like" features. For instance...

## Ebay
[ebay](https://www.ebay.com.au/) - Take a look at the *"Mother's Day gift ideas"* section - see how this section behaves as the page is resized.

## The Verge
[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) Again, see how the layout of the news articles section behaves as the page is resized.

## Meetup
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/) Notice the items *"Join a movement", "learn to cook"*, etc and how that section behaves when the page is resized.

1. Pick one of these sites, or one of your choice.
2. Include a content section on your page which explains your flexbox layout to **Wendy**. Yes, start with "Dear Wendy, ..."

You are not required to reproduce the entire page - just enough to practice on.

Go :)
