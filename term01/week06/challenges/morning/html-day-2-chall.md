# Ruby Cheat Sheet Web Page


In this challenge you will create a Ruby cheat sheet containing a minimum of 6 Ruby reference items. Think of each one as a mini tutorial.

## Your tasks
1. Create a .html page called *my-ruby-cheat-sheet.html*
* Ensure that the [basic document](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp) structure is complete.
* Include a [header](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_header.asp) which contains the title of your page.
* Include a [footer](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_footer.asp) with your name and the date of publication.
* Include a [main](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_main.asp) section to contain the content of your page.

2. Each Ruby reference item in your cheat sheet contains the following:
* A title/heading.
* A description paragraph.
* A [computercode](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_computercode_elements.asp) Ruby snippet.
* A link(s) to the relevant Ruby library documentation.

3. Create an external CSS style sheet which should contain the following styles at a minimum:
* The body should have a pleasing background color and font.
* Headings should have a prominent color.
* A class called "alt-bg-1" and "alt-bg-2" should provide contrasting background colors which are applied to every other paragraph, and provide 10px of **padding**.
* An id called "author-name" which provides a **strong** (bold) text appearance using a pleasing color. Assign this id to the element containing your author name in the footer.


## Bonus:
1. Add the document's author name (you) to the appropriate head element.
2. Include a copyright statement in your footer which displays the copyright symbol.
3. Include a navigation area at the top of your page which provides links to each topic on your page.
